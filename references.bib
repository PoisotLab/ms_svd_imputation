  abstract = {Understanding interspecific viral transmission is key to understanding viral ecology and evolution, disease spillover into humans, and the consequences of global change. Prior studies have uncovered macroecological drivers of viral sharing, but analyses have never attempted to predict viral sharing in a pan-mammalian context. Using a conservative modelling framework, we confirm that host phylogenetic similarity and geographic range overlap are strong, nonlinear predictors of viral sharing among species across the entire mammal class. Using these traits, we predict global viral sharing patterns of 4196 mammal species and show that our simulated network successfully predicts viral sharing and reservoir host status using internal validation and an external dataset. We predict high rates of mammalian viral sharing in the tropics, particularly among rodents and bats, and within- and between-order sharing differed geographically and taxonomically. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological and phylogenetic factors in shaping mammalian viral communities, and provide a robust, general model to predict viral host range and guide pathogen surveillance and conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Despite massive investment in research on reservoirs of emerging pathogens, it remains difficult to rapidly identify the wildlife origins of novel zoonotic viruses. Viral surveillance is costly but rarely optimized using model-guided prioritization strategies, and predictions from a single model may be highly uncertain. Here, we generate an ensemble of seven network- and trait-based statistical models that predict mammal-virus associations, and we use model predictions to develop a set of priority recommendations for sampling potential bat reservoirs and intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses. We find nearly 300 bat species globally could be undetected hosts of betacoronaviruses. Although over a dozen species of Asian horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) are known to harbor SARS-like viruses, we find at least two thirds of betacoronavirus reservoirs in this bat genus might still be undetected. Although identification of other probable mammal reservoirs is likely beyond existing predictive capacity, some of our findings are surprisingly plausible; for example, several civet and pangolin species were highlighted as high-priority species for viral sampling. Our results should not be over-interpreted as novel information about the plausibility or likelihood of SARS-CoV-29s ultimate origin, but rather these predictions could help guide sampling for novel potentially zoonotic viruses; immunological research to characterize key receptors (e.g., ACE2) and identify mechanisms of viral tolerance; and experimental infections to quantify competence of suspected host species.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognizes four species of tick-borne orbiviruses (TBOs): Chenuda virus, Chobar Gorge virus, Wad Medani virus and Great Island virus (genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae). Nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequence comparisons provide a basis for orbivirus detection and classification, however full genome sequence data were only available for the Great Island virus species. We report representative genome-sequences for the three other TBO species (virus isolates: Chenuda virus (CNUV); Chobar Gorge virus (CGV) and Wad Medani virus (WMV)). Phylogenetic comparisons show that TBOs cluster separately from insect-borne orbiviruses (IBOs). CNUV, CGV, WMV and GIV share low level aa/nt identities with other orbiviruses, in `conserved' Pol, T2 and T13 proteins/genes, identifying them as four distinct virus-species. The TBO genome segment encoding cell attachment, outer capsid protein 1 (OC1), is approximately half the size of the equivalent segment from insect-borne orbiviruses, helping to explain why tick-borne orbiviruses have a \textasciitilde 1 kb smaller genome.},

Julia is  designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be ``laws of nature"  by practitioners of numerical computing: \textbackslash beginlist \textbackslash item  High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \textbackslash item  One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \textbackslash item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \textbackslash endlist We introduce the  Julia programming language and its design---a  dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch,  a  technique from computer science, picks  the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that  one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},
