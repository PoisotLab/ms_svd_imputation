The «science of survival» concept has been introduced by Potter in 1970, and
consists in a reflection on the interdependence between a host and its
environment. Potter emphasizes the fact that the humanity's survival relies on
the surrounding biological and ecological systems, their proper functioning, and
can be influenced by their dynamics (Potter, 1970). The current pandemic of
SARS-CoV-2 is a stark reminder that movement of viruses through novel animal
hosts, and ultimately to human through zoonotic spillovers
[@Plowright2017PatZoo], requires that we understand the complexity of our
biological surroundings. Indeed, the fact that the majority of emerging
infectious diseases are caused by zoonotic pathogens from wildlife sources
[@Jones2008GloTre] gives some urgency to the task of predicting which viruses
can be found in which hosts, so as to provide guidance on where and what species
to sample and where spillovers are likely to happen [@Johnson2020GloShi;
@Albery2020PreGlo].

As seen with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, novel human infections by viruses
are representing a serious threat to global public health, and being able to
prevent future viral emergence now appears as a fundamental tool among our
society. Zoonotic dynamics usually involve three main stages: transmission
within the animal reservoir, cross-species spillover and transmission to human,
and finally, transmission among humans [@Lloyd-Smith2009EpiDyn]. In the past
decades, substantial research effort has been put in studying and predicting
dynamics at the animal-human interface, but tracing back the ultimate origin of
novel zoonotic viruses remains a major difficulty [@Becker2020PreWil]. Also, the
main strategy adopted so far against infectious diseases consists in taking
actions after the emergence by increasing the health infrastructures and
vigilance, as well as developing vaccines or medical treatments
[@Han2016FutDir].

As suggested by @Han2016FutDir, a more efficient approach would be anticipatory.
Yet an anticipatory approach can be limited by lack of suitable data, and as
@Becker2020PreWil highlighted, by disagreement between models. The task of
predicting possible host-virus interactions would therefore benefit from adding
methods that allow imputation, and can produce results that are easily added to
ensemble models. Here, we explore an approach focusing on the first stage of
zoonoses dynamics, by using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an
imputation method for identifying unobserved host-virus interactions, acting as
potential intermediate hosts in diseases transmissions.

# Methods

We ran all analyses in *Julia* 1.5.2 [@Bezanson2017JulFre].

## Dataset

We apply SVD imputation to the data on wildlife hosts of beta-coronaviruses
collected by @Becker2020PreWil. This host-virus network is composed of 710
mammalian hosts (resolved at the species level) and 72 viruses (resolved at the
genus level). Full data are available from
`https://github.com/viralemergence/virionette/`. While the host-virus
interaction have been pulled from published sources, specific attention has been
paid to betacoronaviruses, a viral genus at high risk of spillover, and to their
potential bat hosts, a mammalian order known to be evolutionary involved in the
main viruses zoonotic historical epidemics [@Shipley2019BatVir; @Ren2006FulGen].
Data on interactions between these groups were augmented by a GenBank search to
retrieve the hosts associated to sequences of betacoronaviruses. Altogether,
this dataset represents a total of 1731 unique interactions, and 49389
host-virus pairs for which no interaction were reported; these can be true
negatives (the virus is unable to infect the host), or false negatives (the
virus can infect the host but the infection has not been reported). This type of
problem lends itself well to an approach using a recommender system.

## Low-rank approximation with Singular Value Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition [SVD; @Golub1971SinVal; @Forsythe1967ComSol] is a
linear algebra technique used to decompose a data matrix in a product of three
matrices:

$$\mathbf{X} =  \mathbf{U \Sigma V}^T$$ {#eq:svd}

Where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $m \times n$ data matrix ($m \ge n$), $\mathbf{U}$ is an
unitary $m \times m$ matrix containing the left singular vectors, $\mathbf{V}$
is an unitary $n \times n$ matrix containing the right singular vectors and
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values ordered in
decreasing order of importance, in regard of the quantity of information that
they present. This process allows data reduction by finding key correlations
among entries and then by approximating the original matrix.  

Optimal truncation of the SVD at rank $r$ [@Eckart1936AppOne;@Golub1987GenEck]
of the singular values will allow data reduction while keeping enough
information to obtain a balance between complexity and accuracy within the
model. Truncation at rank $r$ was performed by setting values
$\mathbf{\Sigma}_{(r+1)..m}$ to 0 (we note the resulting vector
$^{(r)}\mathbf{\Sigma}$), and the resulting low-rank approximation was obtained
by

$$^{(r)}\mathbf{X} =  \mathbf{U} \, ^{(r)}\mathbf{\Sigma \, V}^T$$ {#eq:lowrank}

We illustrate the process on our dataset in @fig:lowrank. Removing signal from
the matrix through a low-rank approximation hinges on the assumption that most
data are generated by "low-rank" processes, whereas the additional ranks would
reflect noise or idiosyncracies acting in the dataset. Under this assumption, an
imputation method using a low-rank approximation would have a good performance.

![Overview of the dataset (yellow means interaction is more likely, blue means interactions is less likely) at different levels of approximation. At rank very low rank (top row; from left to right, $r=1$ and $r=3$) the matrix is mostly capturing the degree of the different species. At higher ranks (bottom row; from left to right, $r=10$ and $r=60$), the matrix is capturing increasing differences in species interactions.](figures/lowrank_illustration.png){#fig:lowrank}

## Model structure

For each non-interactions in the dataset, the model then assigns an initial
value to it and performs iteratively the SVD at chosen rank, until it reaches
convergence. During this step, the cells in the matrix that are *not* being
imputed are kept at the actual value. We capped the maximal number of iterations
at 50, even though the value of the imputed cells stopped changing (defined as a
step-wise change lower than $10\times \epsilon$) after less than 10 steps in
most cases. The initial value that we first picked for this illustration is the
connectance of the global host-virus interaction dataset, which amounts to the
probability that any pair of organisms are found to interact (0.03).Yet, this
can overestimate the importance of viruses with a narrow host range, or
underestimate the importance of generalist viruses. For this reason, the
assignment of the initial value was then determined based [@Stock2017LinFil]
work on linear filtering. This method provides a convenient way to assign
weights to various aspects of network structure, and has been revealed to
provide a good baseline estimate of how likely it is that a missing interaction
actually exists, based on the structure of the interaction matrix, without the
need of having other side information, such as traits or phylogeny. Considering
our $m \times n$ data matrix $\mathbf{X}$, the initial value of a missing
interaction was fixed to the filtered value $\mathbf{F}_{ij}$ :

$$\mathbf{F}_{i,j} =  \mathbf{\alpha_{1}X_{i,j}+\alpha_{2}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{k=1}^m X_{kj} + \alpha_{3}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{l=1}^n X_{il} + \alpha_{4}\frac{1}{mn}\sum_{k=1}^m\sum_{l=1}^n X_{kl} }$$ {#eq:linearfiltering}

where $\sum\limits_{i=1}^4 \alpha_{i} = 1$ and $\alpha_{i} \in [0,1]$. Using
this filter allowed to test different scenarios. Firstly, weight was only given
to the average of all interaction values in the matrix for the calculation of
the initial value ($\alpha = [0,0,0,1]$), for every chosen rank. Then, weight
was given according to the average in which every host ($\alpha = [0,1,0,0]$),
virus ($\alpha = [0,0,1,0]$), or both ($\alpha = [0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},0]$)
are involved in other interactions. Finally, a combination of the individual
species' degrees and the total average of interactions within the dataset has
been used ($\alpha = [0,\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3}]$). Other schemes to
impute the initial value are possible, for example by relying on the relative
degree of both species, but this would require more guesswork or more
assumptions, in addition to possibly being sensitive to biases in the
preferential sampling of some groups.

## Model validation

For every rank of the SVD, we examined the top 10 non-interactions with the
highest score (even though the model technically returns a score for all
non-interactions). Since there have recently been a number of empirical
investigations regarding host-virus associations, novel bat hosts of
betacoronaviruses have been described following the assembly of the
@Becker2020PreWil dataset used for the model. Therefore, we were able to examine
and compare which of these novel identified bat hosts for betacoronaviruses have
also been recovered by SVD, at all ranks between 1 and 5, to confirm the
accuracy of this technique.

# Results and Discussion

First, we report the top 10 likely hosts for betacoronaviruses, using the
connectance of the network as initial values, which are ranked by their final
value post imputation; larger values should indicate that the interactions are
more likely to be possible. We report the novel hosts (identified post
@Becker2020PreWil, according to `https://www.viralemergence.org/betacov`). These
results are presented in @tbl:top10 - the novel hosts are presented in **bold**.
Using a rank 2 approximation of the dataset, we have 5 novel hosts, and 4
identified as "suspected" hosts by the @Becker2020PreWil ensemble model,
currently lacking empirical evidence. This suggests that rank 2 contains the
most information about the processes generating the data, and can therefore be
used to infer other associations.

Table: Top 10 likely hosts for betacoronaviruses using the connectance of the
network as initial values {#tbl:top10}

Based on this information, we have also extracted the 10 highest scoring
interactions across the entire matrix at rank 2 (Table 2). The results
demonstrates that within the entire dataset, including all mammalian hosts and
viruses' genus, 5 out of the 10 highest scoring interactions are involving bat
hosts (presented in *italic*), and 8 out of the 10 interactions are involving
the lyssavirus genus. This genus includes the rabies virus (RABV), and other
neurotropic rabies-related viruses [@Warrell2004RabOth].

[Table 2: Top 10 likely missing interactions across the entire dataset using the connectance of the network as initial values]

| Hosts species          | Viruses genus |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Sus scrofa             | Lyssavirus    |
| *Hipposideros armiger* | Lyssavirus    |
| Rattus norvegicus      | Lyssavirus    |
| Myodes glareolus       | Lyssavirus    |
| *Pipistrellus abramus* | Lyssavirus    |
| Sus scrofa             | Orbivirus     |
| Capra hircus           | Alphavirus    |
| *Rhinolophus sinicus*  | Lyssavirus    |
| *Myotis ricketti*      | Lyssavirus    |
| *Rhinolophus affinis*  | Lyssavirus    |


Once those results were obtain, further investigations in the form of literature
surveys allowed to identify that the interaction between *Pipistrellus* abramus}
and lyssaviruses has already been noted by @Hu2018LysJap; @Shipley2019BatVir
reported lyssavirus prevalence in the genus *Pipstrellus*, *Myotis*, and
*Rhinolophus*. Other confirmed hosts of lyssaviruses are *Sus scrofa*
[@Sato2004GenPhy], and *Rattus norvegicus* [@Wang2014RabRab]. Surveillance for
novel lyssaviruses infections is of great public health interest, since the
rabies virus is fatal in all cases, once the onset of clinical symptoms has
started [@Banyard2017ImpNov]. Although it is recognized that bats are identified
as reservoir hosts for lyssaviruses, the mechanism allowing the maintenance of
the virus in those populations is still poorly understood [@Banyard2017ImpNov],
and these predictions of interactions might serve as guidance in the monitoring
of new infections.

The two non-lyssaviruses associations have been previously reported in the
literature (*Sus scrofa* and orbivirus by @Belaganahalli2015GenCha; *Capra
hircus* and the equine encephalomyelitis caused by an alphavirus as early as
@Pursell1972NatOcc). This suggests that Singular Value Decomposition of
available data on host-virus associations can uncover results that have been
reported in the primary literature, but not incorporated in the main databases
used in the field; based on the fact that the majority of the top 10 overall
associations were able to be validated from the literature, we suggest that
interactions that have no empirical evidence could be targets for additional
sampling.

The initial value to be used for the imputation was then assigned according to
the linear filter, as presented in the method section. The Table 3 presents the
number of novel hosts predicted by the model, according to the coefficients used
for the filter and to the rank.

[Table 3: Number of novel hosts for betacoronaviruses correctly predicted by the model using linear filtering for the attribution of initial values]

| Alpha  | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|**[0, 0, 0, 1]**|3|3|1|3|4|
|**[0, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, 0]**|3|3|1|3|3|
|**[0, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{3}$]**|3|3|1|4|2|
|**[0, 1, 0, 0]**|3|3|1|3|3|
|**[0, 0, 1, 0]**|3|3|1|4|3|

From the results presented in Table 3, it is possible to see that when using
linear filtering for the assignment of initial values, the choice of the
$\alpha$ parameters does not impact the accuracy of the predictions for the
first three rank. The fourth and fifth rank then showed a variation per $\alpha$
values. The highest scoring interactions for every combinations was then
examined and the variation of its value before and after the imputation has been
calculated, and the results obtained are presented in Table 4. 

[Table 4: Variation of the value pre and post imputation for the highest scoring interaction at every rank]

| Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|0.536|0.765|0.700|0.990|1.261|

This variation was not influenced by the $\alpha$ parameters, but only by the
rank used. The variation calculated increased as the rank got higher.

Being able to identify intermediate animal hosts for potential zoonotic
pathogens is an important step in the fight against potential threats to global
public health. Using SVD as an imputation method to predict those interactions
has demonstrated its potential to achieve this goal by correctly identifying the
majority of the most likely associations, as validated by literature surveys,
and by suggesting interactions with no empirical evidence as targets for
additional sampling. Host-virus associations are a challenging imputation
problem, because organized datasets are scarce -- as a result, a lot of missing
associations are reported in the literature, but not available in an easily
usable format. Yet this also presents an opportunity to validate the performance
of recommender systems that is far more interesting than cross-fold or
leave-one-out validation: the existence of these interactions in the literature
can provide validation on data that have never been used in the modeling
process, and therefore provide an accurate estimate of how frequently existing
interactions are identified. By this measure, that most of the top 10
recommendations on this dataset were validated through *de novo* sampling (for
bat hosts of betacoronaviruses) or by a literature survey (for the global
dataset) is a strong indication that SVD is able to uncover likely host-virus
pairs.

Future work on the use of SVD for virus host associations will have to adress
the question of the initial value used in the imputation process in further
details. As of now, we relied on the average number of interactions in the
matrix, and on weighted allocations for different aspects of the network
structure, based on @Stock2017LinFil work on linear filtering. This method can
provide a good baseline estimate of how likely it is that a missing interaction
could actually exist (and in fact was developed for this purpose). For this
reason, we are confident that the performance of the approach can further be
improved by fine-tuning the choice of the initial value used for imputation,
according to the dataset used, or by relying on ensemble models that would
aggregate the output of the best recommenders. Combining an accurate model for
the initial value with the SVD imputation is likely to generate predicted
interactions that are strong candidates for empirical validation.
